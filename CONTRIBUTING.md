## Branching Strategy

### Persistent Branches
- `main` — production-ready code
- `develop` — integration branch for ongoing work

### Topic Branches
- `dev/<feature>` — feature branches (e.g., `dev/fix-convergence`)
- `fix/<issue>` — bug fixes
- `exp/<name>` — experimental / throwaway work

All merges into `main` must be peer reviewed via a GitLab Merge Request (or GitHub Pull Request).
Topic branch work is normally merged into `develop` first; direct merges to
`main` require explicit sign-off from the lead developer.
Case-specific work may be done directly on `develop` with lead-developer
approval.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base',
           'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': false} } }%%
gitGraph LR:
   commit id: "initial"

   branch develop
   checkout develop
   commit id: "dev work"

   branch dev/my-feature
   checkout dev/my-feature
   commit id: "feat: init"
   commit id: "feat: done"

   checkout develop
   merge dev/my-feature id: "MR: feature → develop"

   checkout main
   branch fix/hotfix
   checkout fix/hotfix
   commit id: "hotfix"
   checkout main
   merge fix/hotfix id: "hotfix MR (direct)"

   checkout develop
   merge main id: "sync from main"

   checkout develop
   branch fix/some-bug
   checkout fix/some-bug
   commit id: "fix: bug"
   checkout develop
   merge fix/some-bug id: "MR: fix → develop"

   branch exp/prototype
   checkout exp/prototype
   commit id: "e1"
   commit id: "e2"

   checkout main
   merge develop id: "release MR"
```

**Key rules encoded in the diagram:**

| Branch | Created from | Merges into | Requires MR? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `develop` | `main` | `main` | Yes |
| `dev/<feature>` | `develop` or `main` | `develop` or `main`* | Yes |
| `fix/<issue>` | `develop` or `main` | `develop` or `main`* | Yes |
| `exp/<name>` | anywhere | typically abandoned | — |

\* Direct merge to `main` requires lead-developer approval.
